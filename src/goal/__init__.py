# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Python 3.14 / Hydra 1.3.2 compatibility shim.
#
# Python 3.14 added an *eager* ``argparse._ActionsContainer._check_help`` that
# format-checks every action's help string at ``add_argument`` time.  Hydra
# 1.3.2's ``--shell-completion`` argument is registered with a
# ``LazyCompletionHelp()`` instance whose only purpose is to defer rendering
# of the help text — it doesn't implement ``__contains__``, so the new
# eager check raises ``TypeError`` and aborts every entry point that uses
# ``@hydra.main`` (``goal-train``, ``goal-eval``, ``goal-finetune``,
# ``goal-tune``, ``goal-simulate``, ``goal-simulate-mts``).
#
# We restore the pre-3.14 behaviour by making ``_check_help`` swallow the
# eager validation failure.  The help text is still validated when ``--help``
# is invoked for real, so users see exactly the same diagnostics.
