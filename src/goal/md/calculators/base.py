"""Shared exception types for GOAL calculators and foundation-model wrappers.

Kept dependency-free on purpose: this module imports nothing from
``goal`` (nor ase/torch), so it can be imported from either the MD side
(``goal.md.core.calculator_factory``) or, lazily, from the ML side
(``goal.ml.nn.models.foundation``) without dragging in heavy packages or
creating an import cycle.
