"""Fragment decomposition — how a structure is split into fragments.

A *fragment* is a group of atoms that
:class:`~goal.ml.nn.blocks.fragment_interaction.EquivariantFragmentInteraction`
treats as one unit: their features are pooled, the pooled representations
exchange equivariant messages, and the result is handed back to every
atom.  What counts as "one unit" is a modelling choice, so five schemes
are available, selected by ``data.fragment_scheme``:

=================== ================================================== =========
scheme              splits on                                          needs rdkit
=================== ================================================== =========
``connected``       distance graph at ``covalent_cutoff``              no
``rdkit_components`` connected components of the *perceived* molecule  yes
``rotatable``       every non-ring single bond between heavy atoms     yes
``brics``           BRICS retrosynthetic rules (``rdkit.Chem.BRICS``)   yes
``recap``           RECAP cleavage rules (``rdkit.Chem.Recap``)         yes
``custom``          your own SMARTS bond patterns (``smarts=``)         yes
=================== ================================================== =========

Which to pick depends on what you want the module to model:

* ``connected`` (default) gives **physically separate molecules** — the
  cutoff is deliberately far shorter than the MLIP interaction cutoff, so
  two molecules 3 Å apart are two fragments even though every atom pair
  is inside the model's receptive field.  The fragment channel then
  models genuine non-bonded interaction.  On a single covalently
  connected molecule it yields ``K = 1`` and the channel is a no-op.
* ``rotatable`` / ``brics`` / ``recap`` cut a **single molecule** into
  chemically meaningful groups, turning the channel into a
  coarse-grained *intramolecular* pathway: pooled groups exchange
  messages directly instead of atom-by-atom along the chain.  Worth the
  cost mainly when the fragment cutoff exceeds the atom cutoff, so
  distant parts of one molecule couple in a single step.
* ``rdkit_components`` is ``connected`` computed on the perceived
  molecule.  It normally agrees with ``connected`` exactly; it exists so
  you can confirm that, and so bond perception (rather than a distance
  threshold) decides what "bonded" means.
* ``custom`` cuts exactly the bonds *you* name in ``smarts``, for when no
  rule set matches your chemistry.

Two hints apply on top of any scheme: ``keep_groups`` names SMARTS whose
atoms must share a fragment, and ``smarts`` drives ``custom``.  rdkit's
own BRICS/RECAP rules are hard-coded module data with no settings file, so
these are the supported way to encode chemistry knowledge.

Every scheme returns the same thing: contiguous ``(N,)`` int64 labels,
ordered by each fragment's lowest atom index, requiring no supervision.

Implementation notes
--------------------
Connected components are found by **label propagation** (iterated
``amin`` over the bond graph) rather than ``scipy.sparse.csgraph``:
``scipy`` is not a declared GOAL dependency, and label propagation is a
handful of vectorised torch ops with no host round-trips beyond the
convergence check.  The bond graph itself is built in row chunks so a
10 000-atom cell never materialises an ``(N, N, 3)`` displacement
tensor.

The rdkit schemes need bond perception (``rdDetermineBonds``, the
xyz2mol algorithm) which is far more expensive and can fail on radicals,
unusual valences or a wrong total charge.  Two things make that
practical: results are **cached on the bond graph** — perception depends
only on connectivity and charge, so every frame of an MD trajectory whose
topology is unchanged reuses one perception — and a failure falls back to
``connected`` with a single warning rather than killing the run.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : Tensor ``(N, 3)``
        Cartesian atomic positions (Angstrom).
    atomic_numbers : Tensor ``(N,)``
        Atomic numbers.  Used by the rdkit schemes to build the molecule;
        the ``connected`` scheme only checks that the two inputs describe
        the same structure (its bond criterion is a single
        element-agnostic distance threshold).
    covalent_cutoff : float
        Bond threshold in Angstrom (default ``1.8``).  Defines the bond
        graph for ``connected``, and for the rdkit schemes it is the
        fallback criterion and the cache key.
    cell : Tensor ``(3, 3)`` or ``(1, 3, 3)``, optional
        Lattice vectors.  Together with *pbc* this applies the minimum
        image convention, so a molecule straddling a periodic boundary
        stays one fragment instead of splitting in two.
    pbc : Tensor ``(3,)``, optional
        Periodic-boundary flags.  Ignored when *cell* is absent or
        all-zero (the molecular case).
    scheme : str
        One of :data:`FRAGMENT_SCHEMES` — see the module docstring for
        what each one splits on and when to prefer it.
    charge : int
        Total charge handed to rdkit's bond perception.  Wrong here means
        perception fails or invents bond orders, so set it for ionic
        systems.
    on_failure : ``"fallback"`` or ``"raise"``
        What to do when an rdkit scheme cannot perceive the molecule.
        ``"fallback"`` (default) warns once and uses ``connected`` for
        that structure; ``"raise"`` propagates, which is what you want
        when a silently degraded decomposition would ruin an experiment.
    smarts : sequence of str, optional
        Bond patterns to cut, for ``scheme="custom"``.  Each pattern
        either has exactly two atoms (the bond between them is cut) or
        marks the two ends with atom maps ``:1`` and ``:2``.  Ignored by
        every other scheme.
    keep_groups : sequence of str, optional
        SMARTS whose matched atoms must end up in the **same** fragment,
        applied on top of *any* scheme.  Two things happen: a bond is
        never cut when both its ends lie inside one match, and the final
        labels are merged so the guarantee holds even when the base
        scheme had already separated them.  This is how you tell a
        chemistry-driven scheme to leave a group alone — ``["C(=O)O"]``
        keeps a carboxyl intact instead of letting BRICS shed its ``OH``.
        Needs rdkit, so it adds a perception step to ``connected``.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor ``(N,)`` int64
        Fragment labels, contiguous and 0-indexed
        (``labels.max() + 1 == n_fragments``).  Labels are ordered by
        the lowest atom index each fragment contains, so atom 0 always
        belongs to fragment 0 and the numbering is deterministic.

    Examples
    --------
    A single methane molecule yields one fragment::

        >>> labels = compute_fragment_index(ch4_pos, ch4_z)
        >>> int(labels.max()) + 1
        1

    Two water molecules 3 Å apart yield two::

        >>> labels = compute_fragment_index(dimer_pos, dimer_z)
        >>> int(labels.max()) + 1
        2

    One butanoic acid cut at its rotatable bonds yields five::

        >>> labels = compute_fragment_index(acid_pos, acid_z, scheme="rotatable")
        >>> int(labels.max()) + 1
        5
