"""MLIP diagnostic metrics computed at every train/val step.

Standard MLFF-paper metrics (MAE/RMSE per atom for energy, MAE/RMSE
and cosine-similarity / magnitude split for forces, Newton-violation
for translation invariance).  Computed alongside the loss so the
progress bar and loggers can show *physically meaningful* numbers
even when the loss values themselves are weighted sums of several
components.

The entry point is :func:`mlip_metrics(predictions, batch)` which
returns a flat ``{name: scalar tensor}`` dict.  The training loop
prefixes the keys with ``"train/"`` or ``"val/"`` and feeds them to
Lightning's ``log_dict``.

Metrics emitted
---------------
``energy_mae_per_atom``, ``energy_rmse_per_atom``, ``forces_mae``,
``forces_rmse``, ``forces_cosine_similarity``, ``forces_magnitude_mae``,
and the Newton violation as **four** numbers:
``newton_violation_{x,y,z}`` per Cartesian axis plus ``newton_violation``
for their sum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    predictions : dict
        Model output.  Must contain ``"energy"`` shape ``(G,)`` and
        ``"num_atoms"`` shape ``(G,)``.  ``"forces"`` shape
        ``(N, 3)`` is optional — when absent the force-side metrics
        are skipped.
    batch : AtomicGraph / pyg.Batch
        Reference labels.  Reads ``batch.energy`` (per graph) and
        ``batch.forces`` (per atom) when present.  ``batch.batch``
        is the per-atom graph index (PyG convention).

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        ``{metric_name: 0-d Tensor}``.  Metrics that can't be
        computed (e.g. forces requested but no labels available) are
        simply omitted from the dict.
