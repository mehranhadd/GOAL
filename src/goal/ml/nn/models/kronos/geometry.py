"""Differentiable edge-geometry recomputation.

Neighbour lists shipped with :class:`goal.ml.data.graph.AtomicGraph` are
materialised once (typically inside ``from_ase``).  The resulting
``edge_attr`` and ``edge_weight`` tensors are concrete data, *not*
connected to ``graph.pos`` in the autograd graph.  For force prediction
via ``torch.autograd.grad(E, positions)`` the model must therefore
recompute edge vectors and lengths *from* ``graph.pos`` inside the
forward pass, so that the dependency exists.

Helper preserves PBC correctness using the integer ``unit_shifts``
stored on the graph (when present).  The closed-form rule is::

    r_ij = positions[col] - positions[row] + S_ij @ cell_of_graph(row)

where ``S_ij`` is the integer cell-shift vector and ``cell_of_graph``
selects the unit cell of the graph that owns atom ``row``.  For
non-periodic systems ``S_ij`` is zero and the shift term vanishes.
