"""Full model architectures.

Drop a new ``.py`` file into this folder with the registration
decorators on its class (``@MODEL_REGISTRY.register("name")`` and, for
backbones, also ``@BACKBONE_REGISTRY.register("name")``) and it is
discovered automatically — no edit to this file required.

The project ships four reference models:

* ``invariant_gnn``     — SchNet-style **invariant** backbone
                          (educational baseline).
* ``hyperspec``         — Native equivariant **modular** backbone using
                          e3nn primitives (educational baseline).
* ``monolithic_example``— Minimal **monolithic** model returning the
                          property dict directly (educational baseline).
* ``kronos`` / ``kronos_monolithic`` — The **native** KRONOS model
                          (K-order Routed Orthogonal Network of Symmetry
                          with Element-Pair Mixture-of-Experts).  See
                          :mod:`goal.ml.nn.models.kronos`.
