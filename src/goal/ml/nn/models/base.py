"""Protocol definitions for model backbones and task heads.

Every major component is defined by a ``Protocol`` — a structural
interface that any class satisfying it automatically implements,
without inheritance. This enables duck typing with static type checking.

Four backbone types are supported:
- ``EquivariantBackbone`` — uses e3nn irreps (MACE, NequIP, etc.)
- ``InvariantBackbone`` — outputs scalar features only (SchNet, DimeNet, etc.)
- ``FeatureExtractorBackbone`` — equivariant backbone with intermediate layer extraction
- ``Backbone`` — universal protocol accepting any output format
