"""Adaptive depth gate — optional add-on for ARACE rounds.

Every atom currently receives the same number of message-passing rounds.
Physically that is wasteful: an interior atom in a saturated chain is
converged after one round, while an atom at a reactive centre or a
fragment boundary keeps changing.  This module learns a per-atom gate
that decides how much of each round's update an atom actually keeps.

Two regimes, deliberately different:

**Training (soft)**
    ``h_next = g_i · h_new + (1 - g_i) · h_prev`` — fully differentiable,
    every atom still updates, but the gate magnitude shapes the gradient
    each atom receives.  Atoms the gate calls converged get smaller
    updates, pushing capacity towards the hard ones.

**Inference (hard)**
    ``g_i > threshold`` keeps ``h_new``, otherwise the atom keeps
    ``h_prev`` and effectively exits early.  This is where the compute
    saving lives.  Never used during training — a step function has zero
    gradient, so training through it would silently freeze the gate.

**Why the gate is invariant, and why that is not a compromise.**  For
``h_next = g·h_new + (1-g)·h_prev`` to be equivariant, ``g`` *must* be
invariant: a gate that rotated with the frame would scale different
irrep blocks by rotation-dependent factors and destroy the symmetry.
This is the same construction as :class:`e3nn.nn.Gate` — invariant
scalars gating equivariant blocks — not a scalars-only shortcut.

What *is* a real choice is how finely the gate resolves the feature
vector, and ``per_irrep`` controls it:

* ``per_irrep=False`` — one gate for the whole vector.
* ``per_irrep=True`` (recommended) — one gate per irrep block, each still
  invariant, each applied to its own block.  The model can then keep the
  ``l = 1`` update of an atom while damping a noisy ``l = 2`` one, which a
  single scalar cannot express.  The convergence signal is likewise split
  per block, so the gate sees *which* angular channel is still moving
  instead of one blended norm.

Enabled per config section (``model.backbone.adaptive_gate``); absent
section → the ARACE round never builds the module and the forward path is
bit-identical to plain ARACE.

    """Per-atom gate over a round's node-feature update.

    Parameters
    ----------
    irreps_node : Irreps or str
        Node feature irreps.  Used to locate the ``l = 0`` channels,
        which must be the leading block (standard ARACE ordering).
    n_scalar : int
        Width of the gate's scalar input projection.
    hard_threshold : float
        Gate value above which an atom updates at inference (default
        ``0.5``).
    aux_loss_weight : float
        Weight ``λ`` on the auxiliary sparsity loss ``λ · mean(g_i)``,
        which pushes the gate to be selective rather than permanently
        open.  ``0.0`` disables it (the gate then only ever feels the
        energy/force gradients).  Default ``0.01``.
    init_bias : float
        Initial bias on the gate logits (default ``1.0`` →
        ``sigmoid(1) ≈ 0.73``, i.e. open).  Starting open means the model
        begins as (nearly) standard ARACE and must *learn* to close
        specific atoms, which is far more stable than starting closed and
        learning to open.
    per_irrep : bool
        ``True`` (recommended) → one invariant gate per irrep block, and
        one convergence ratio per block as extra gate input.  ``False`` →
        a single gate and a single global convergence ratio for the whole
        feature vector.  Both are exactly equivariant; the per-block form
        is strictly more expressive.
